## Key Features
 - **Dynamic Content Editing**: Leverage the power of Django's admin panel locally to effortlessly edit and manage every aspect of your website's content. This ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience when updating information or showcasing new projects.

- **Automated Deployment**: Embrace hassle-free hosting through GitHub Pages. The project is intelligently configured to automatically generate a static version of the website whenever changes are made. This static version is then seamlessly pushed to GitHub, making your latest updates instantly available to the world.

- **Local Security**: Enjoy the peace of mind that comes with the ability to run and modify the live version of your website locally. This local environment not only ensures a secure testing ground but also empowers you to refine your content and design with ease.

By merging the versatility of Django with the convenience of GitHub Pages, this portfolio website represents a harmonious blend of dynamic content management and straightforward hosting.
